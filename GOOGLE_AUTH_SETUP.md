This document outlines the Google Authentication implementation for the FilmdleGame project.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- Updated `src/lib/auth.js` to include Google Auth functions
- Added `signInWithPopup` and `GoogleAuthProvider` imports

  - Loading state with spinner animation
  - Error handling
  - Hover effects
  - Disabled state support
  - Customizable props (onSuccess, onError, className, disabled)

### 3. Updated Login Component
- Added Google Sign-In button to `src/Login.jsx`
- Integrated with existing email/password login
- Added visual separator ("or" divider)
- Proper error handling for Google Auth

### 4. Updated SignUp Component
- Added Google Sign-In button to `src/SignUp.jsx`
- Automatic user data creation in Firestore for Google users
- Consistent styling with Login component

### 5. CSS Styling
- Added spinner animation for loading state
- Google Sign-In button styling
- Responsive design considerations

## Firebase Console Setup Required

To complete the Google Authentication setup, you need to:

1. **Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to your Firebase project console
   - Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Google" provider
   - Add your domain to authorized domains

2. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
   - Configure your app details
   - Add authorized domains

3. **Set up OAuth 2.0 Client IDs:**
   - In Google Cloud Console, go to APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID for web application
   - Add your domain to authorized JavaScript origins

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```jsx
import GoogleSignInButton from './components/GoogleSignInButton.jsx';

<GoogleSignInButton 
  onSuccess={(user) => console.log('User signed in:', user)}
  onError={(error) => console.error('Sign-in error:', error)}
/>
```

### With Custom Styling
```jsx
<GoogleSignInButton 
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
  onError={handleError}
  className="custom-google-btn"
  disabled={isLoading}
/>
```

## Features

- ✅ Google Sign-In with popup
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility support
- ✅ Customizable styling
- ✅ Integration with existing auth flow
- ✅ Automatic user data creation in Firestore

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login/signup page
3. Click the "Continue with Google" button
4. Complete the Google OAuth flow
5. Verify user is signed in and data is saved to Firestore

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"This app is not verified"** - Complete OAuth consent screen setup
2. **"Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"** - Check authorized domains in Google Cloud Console
3. **"Google Sign-In not working"** - Verify Google provider is enabled in Firebase Console

### Debug Mode:
Uncomment the test function in `src/test-google-auth.js` to test Google Auth independently.

## Security Notes

- Google Auth tokens are handled securely by Firebase
- User data is stored in Firestore with proper security rules
- No sensitive data is stored in localStorage
- All authentication state is managed through Firebase Auth

## Next Steps

1. Complete Firebase Console setup
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Remove test files (`src/test-google-auth.js`)
4. Deploy and test in production environment
